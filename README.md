# Smile-Detection-using-CNN
Comparing results of different state-of-the-art CNN architectures built on SMILES dataset.

Dataset of SMILES was taken from https://github.com/hromi/SMILEsmileD

The state-of-the-art CNN architecctures used to compare:
1) ResNet50
2) VGG16
3) ResNet152V2
4) Xception
5) InceptionResNetV2
6) LeNet5
